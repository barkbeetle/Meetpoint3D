# Meetpoint3D

Simple anonymous online chat room visualized with WebGL.

### Setup

Setting up Meetpoint3D is fairly easy. Just copy the code into a directory of your apache server with PHP support.

If you want to use a different game server than the one provided, change the serverAddress variable at the top of js/level1.js (see github.com/barkbeetle/Meepoint3DServer for more information about the game server)
